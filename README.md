Molecular Properties Analysis  

ABOUT:
Simple analysis of drug compound properties (Aspirin, Paracetamol, etc.) from PubChem data.  
Key Features  :
- Downloads data directly from PubChem  
- Checks data quality  
- Creates 2 plots:  
  1. Molecular Weight vs LogP  
  2. LogP comparison between compounds  
How to Use:
1. Run the Jupyter notebook  
2. See plots and analysis  
3. (Optional) Edit notebook to add more compounds  
What the Data Shows :
- Which compounds dissolve best in water/fat  
- How size affects compound properties
